            <h3>Philippines Extends Lower Pork Prices: Tariff Reduction Continues Until 2024 for Affordable Access</h3>
            <p>Extending the reduction in pork prices in the Philippines until 2024 might have some downsides, especially 
               for the workers in the pork industry. While lower prices benefit consumers, it could potentially result in 
               reduced earnings for those putting in the hard work.</p>

            <p>When prices are lowered, businesses may face financial challenges, impacting the income of workers within the
               industry. These individuals, who play a crucial role in the production process, could see a reduction in their
               wages as a result. It's essential to consider the potential repercussions on their livelihoods, especially in a
               time when economic uncertainties are prevalent.</p>

            <p>While the goal is to make pork more affordable for consumers, it's crucial to strike a balance that doesn't 
               disproportionately affect the income and well-being of the workers contributing significantly to the industry. 
               It raises questions about how the government can ensure that policies aimed at benefiting consumers don't 
               inadvertently harm the financial stability of the hardworking individuals in the process.</p>

            <p>The Philippines is making piggy prices lower until 2024 to help people get pork without spending too much money. 
                But wait, is it all good news? Some people think it might not be that great because it could make our local piggy 
                farmers sad. They might not be able to sell as much pork because other pork from faraway lands is cheaper. That's 
                a bit tricky, isn't it?</p>
                
            <p>Imagine if our own piggy farmers can't sell much pork because everyone's buying the cheaper ones from other places. 
                That might make our local farmers feel really, really sad. And if they can't sell enough, they might not have enough 
                money to take care of their own families. That's not fair, is it? We want our farmers to be happy too!</p>
                
            <p>Also, the Philippines is bringing in pork from far, far away, which means the pork has to travel a long, long way on big,
                noisy vehicles. That's not very good for our Earth. Those vehicles make lots of smoke and bad things that can hurt our planet. 
                So, maybe we should think about how we can help our own piggy farmers and our Earth together. It's like trying to solve a puzzle 
                with pieces that fit for everyone!</p>
                
            <p>So, what's the solution? Maybe we can find a way to help our local piggy farmers without hurting them. We can think about how to make 
                pork prices fair for everyone, so our piggy farmers can be happy, and we can take care of our Earth too. It's like finding the right 
                pieces for our puzzle, so everyone can smile and have yummy pork without any problems. Let's be smart and kind together!
